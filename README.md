# Computational Finance

A collection of **numerical methods** and **computational techniques** applied to **financial data analysis** and **modeling**. This repository demonstrates various approaches to solving financial problems, such as forecasting, interpolation, and more.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Projects in This Repo:

#### 1. üìà Momentum-Based Stock Strategy

This project implements a **momentum investing strategy** using historical stock data from the S&P 500. It ranks stocks based on their past 6-month performance (excluding the most recent month), selects the top 20 each month, and simulates a portfolio that rebalances monthly.

#### Repository:
Check this project out on [This Repository](https://github.com/KlarenceKPIs/momentum-strategy).

### Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. It is not financial advice. Historical performance does not guarantee future results.

## 2. **Newton's Interpolation Polynomial (S&P500)**

A web-based **Newton's Interpolation Polynomial** calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This tool performs interpolation on **S&P500 historical data** and allows users to input custom data points for financial analysis.

#### Demo:
Check out the live demo on [GitHub Pages](https://klarencekpis.github.io/Newton-s-Interpolating-Polynomial/).

- **Predefined Dataset:** Historical S&P500 data points (monthly closing prices).
- **User-defined Dataset:** Input your own data points for interpolation.
- **Features:** 
  - Real-time **S&P500 chart** visualization.
  - Display of the **Newton interpolation polynomial** and the result at a specific point.

#### Key Insights:
- Uses **S&P500** historical data as a foundation for interpolation.
- Can be applied to **market trend forecasting** or **missing data estimation** in financial datasets.
- **Interactive chart** for visual analysis of financial trends.
